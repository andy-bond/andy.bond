## Getting to Greece ✈️

This was way more stressful than expected... the day we were leaving I woke up at 6am thinking about how excited I was to get on the road! I turn over in bed & see a message from Air Canada indicating that our flight was rebooked and we wouldn't arrive in Greece until much later than expected... (insert "this is fine" meme).

After weighing the pros & cons of awaking Kayla from her slumber, I decided she'd want to know ASAP. I explained to her that we'd be arriving in Athens too late to reach Santorini on the flight we had already booked. Once she realized I wasn't making a really terrible joke she exclaimed "What are we gonna do in Athens!?!" which I found to be hilarious. My first thought was "well, I guess we'll have to just enjoy our ouselves in Athens..."

Anyways, Air Canada helped us out & got us booked on another flight that would arrive in time. There were a few more delays in the process, but we eventually arrived in the Athens airport, met Michael & Lyndsie (my sibling-in-laws), and boarded our final flight to the island of Santorini!
